# ISO 27000 standards
The ISO 27000 family of standards deal with information security. Most cloud vendors incorporate ISO 27000 compliance into their overall security strategy. The standard defines the requirements for an information security management system (ISMS) including how to put such a system in place, ensure that procedures are followed, and update security procedures as new threats are released. 

In 2006, the original publication defining security standards was released as ISO 27001. Over the next few years, security analysts and researchers argued that while the 27001 standard was a good start, the requirements it laid out were inadequate to meet the security demands of a large organization. As a result, ISO 27001 grew into what are now referred to as the ISO 27000 (or ISO 27k) family of standards. The family was first published 2013 and the most recent revision was in 2018. The full list of standards in the ISO 27k family is as follows:
