Workflow Management
=============

This is a tool for managing workflows in a cloudmesh context. A _workflow_ is a set of Python functions (that we call tasks or nodes) that need to be run together, some in sequence and some in parallel. This tool allows you to define workflows, indicate how they should be run, and run them. You can also visualize your workflows, including the current status of nodes that are running, and the dependency network between them.
